# To do

 - [X] ~Tek Logo in A1 of each new sheet~
 - [X] ~Conditional formatting for Fail in DS tab~
 - [] Finding the worst error of the failures, for each parameter
 - [X] ~Switching to pathlib for cross-platform compatibility~
  - [X] ~Add Data validation to Column AI for the drop down selection~
  - [] Build the GUI frontend for my colleagues - likely tkinter
  - [] Build the GUI, et al into consolidated exe package (work uses windows), and a unix/linux version (for all one of us working from home on our linux PCs [that's me]) via pyinstaller
